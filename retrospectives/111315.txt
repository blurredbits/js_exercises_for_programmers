Friday the 13th.

Not normally superstitous, but what a day. First and foremost, the attacks on Paris. 

Over 100 confirmed dead? What the hell is going on in this world?

Can't even imagine this sort of attack in America - well, actually, given the extremists that
are already present in this country - maybe that isn't so far fetched.

In any event that was just ONE thing that happened today. Sorry for the departure, but
coding just wasn't on my mind today.

First, I got a call from the unemployment office - apparently, my previous company disputed
the fact that I said that I was laid-off. Won't jump into too many details - but
there seems to be a serious case of asshole happening at my previous company.

Along those lines, I found out tonight that one of the previous engineers that I worked with
was let go. A really nice guy, and based on previous conversation guess he just didn't
fit the "new" mold. Assholes, indeed.

Ok. Coding.

Not nearly enough accomplished today - but still got a chance to play with let/const and
following the pattern that I built yesterday (instantiatng objects with the results from the
prompter object).

Didn't finish it - but got a good start on the Temperature Converter. A bit of wrinkle in that
I want to ask for input first - make a decision based on that input and then ask for more
input. I'm sure it won't be that difficult - just a bit different from the usual pattern
that I've been following so far.

That is all. Tomorrow is a new day.
